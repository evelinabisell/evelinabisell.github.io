        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I always keep a note in my phone with my personal goals and I try to go in and read it 
          as often as I can. I'm going to share some of them here (ordered by importance), as they 
          might give some idea of where I'm currently headed with my life.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Get a job as a programmer</li>
          <li>Make a video game</li>
          <li>Travel to 30 countries before turning 30</li>
          <li>Get a masters degree</li>
          <li>Learn Japanese</li>
          <li>Get a cat</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Dreams</h2>
        <p>I also have some goals that I don't feel like I have to fulfill. It could be because they 
          seem too difficult for me right now, too far away in time, or that it's too hard to judge 
          when they are completed. So I'll call them my <mark>dreams</mark>. But who knows, some of 
          them might become goals in the future.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start my own company</li>
          <li>Travel to 100 countries</li>

        I like switching up where I get my work done. Like in this picture where I brought my laptop to sit at the dining table.
